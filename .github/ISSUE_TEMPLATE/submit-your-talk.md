- The more 👍 the higher priority to be scheduled if there are more talks at the same time.

Actions:
1. Please complete the followings
2. Please cross reference your speaker profile through GitHub issue system using `#`.
3. If you are not a native English speaker, try your best to prepare your talks. 

Advices:
- The English fluency is not the most critical part to let your audience understand your messages.
- Speak slowly with well prepared point-by-point presentation slides could also help you catch your audience attentions.
- We understand 15 minutes lightning talk is difficult to fresh speaker.  Focus the most interesting part or most passionated part to deep dive. 
- Resonate with your audience through thought leadership, references and follow up. You can always discuss deeper with them in the networking sections.

# Introduction

We strive to develop a sophisticated system that operates with full transparency, adheres to an open-source structure, and embraces a community-driven approach. We firmly believe that these elements are the most effective way showcasing our passion and the exceptional quality of our events.

This repository is carefully designed for:

- Facilitating transparent collaboration between organizers and speakers.
- Encouraging positive interaction between speakers and the audience.
- Hosting events systematically and transparently.


We have utilized the power of Git and GitHub issues to build our platform with transparency. We use the [issues templates](https://github.com/GDGHongKong/Software-Builders-Night/issues/new/choose) to handle the following operations:

- Onboarding new speakers.
- Storing complete historical records of each speaker's speeches, which will serve as excellent public portfolios for their careers.
- Accepting talk submissions.
- Tracking the full lifecycle and resonance of each talk, allowing everyone to show support, provide feedback, and engage in deeper discussions before or after the event.
- Maintaining the organizer handbook for running recurring software builders' night events.
- Keeping a comprehensive historical record of contributions from our sponsors.

### Our Vision

Connect software engineering professionals to foster mutual growth.

### Why?

We believe building a good software will satisfy your users, and drive your career to success.

However, the definition of "good" grows / expands over time.

To continuously stay with "good", we want to foster the bonding between engineers in Hong Kong 
to continuously exchange their engineering experience across domains and companies.

### The Mutual Growth

We strongly believe having mutual benefits between the organizers, speakers, and audiences is 
the only way to sustain the community.

#### Speakers

- Receive feedbacks from your audience to improve your presentation skills.
- Get the source of motivation to dive deeper and consolidate related knowledges into a lightning 
presentation.
- Grow your reputation in the software engineering industry.
- Connect more passionate professionals who share the same vision.

#### Audience

- Learn from the presentations shared by the speakers, i.e. the design process, 
thought leadership, problem solving techniques, etc.
- Get more software engineering directions to dive deep and avoid pitfalls
- Converge the learning and create positive impacts in your organization
- Connect more passionate professionals who share the same vision.
